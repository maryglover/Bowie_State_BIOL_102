### Course materials

The required textbook is a modified version of **_Principles in Biology_, 2nd ed. by Robert Brooker**. 

You can get the book in a few different places. If you are not sure about the version that you find, please contact me. You may also see a CONNECT version online, which is more expensive. We will ***NOT*** be using CONNECT in this course.

- The bookstore carries a version of this textbook which only includes the chapters we will cover at a reduced price.
- You can rent the textbook from amazon for around $40 (as of June 2020). [linked here] (https://www.amazon.com/Principles-Biology-Robert-Brooker/dp/1259875121)
- You can also find used copies online from a variety of sources of the full book, which would be fine for the class.

## Course Components

### Grade breakdown

Component | Percentage of grade
 :-- | :-- 
Weekly concept checks | 10%
Assignments | 15% 
Participation and engagment | 5% 
Reflection essays | 20% 
Exams | 25% 
Laboratory | 25% 

***Grading scale***: A: 90 - 100%, B: 80 - 90%, C: 70 - 80%, D: 60 - 70%, F: < 50%

### Weekly concept checks (10%)
Concept checks will be given each week to assess student progress on class topics. Concept checks are designed to allow students to practice for exams and for instructor to assess competency in topics. 

**All concept checks will be due on Blackboard every Sunday at 11:59 PM.**

Concept checks are graded for effort, so students are expected to complete the concept checks closed book and independently. This is to allow both the student and the instructor to identify what topics need improvement. ***Answers on concept checks that are not completed independently and in your own words will receive a grade of zero.***

### Assignments (15%)

Before each class, students will be assigned reading from the textbook and/or other readings. In addition to the reading, there will be a set of questions based on the readings (for example, definitions, outlines, etc.) that will be checked by the instructor at the beginning of class for completion. ***Periodically***, questions will be collected by the instructor and graded for content. These questions are to ensure that students are prepared for class and have engaged with the reading assignments. The problems will be used in the class lecture. 

Additional assignments will also be given throughout the semester, both in class and out of class. 

### Reflection essays (20%)

For each unit, students will be expected to connect a piece of media to the course content. Students will be asked to find a recent (no older than 1 month at the time of submission) biological news article or other media work, such as a podcast. Students will write a summary and explain how the piece connects to something that we have learned in class. Essays should be 1 full page, single spaced, in 12 pt. font. Students may turn in the assignment at any time during the unit and ***no later than 1 week after the completion of the unit.*** 

### Participation (5%)

Students are expected to actively participate in the course. Twice during the semester, once at the midterm and once at the end of the course, students will be graded on their participation in lecture. Students will be assessed on the following:

- Regular class attendance
- Contribution to class discussion and active participation in group work
- Attentiveness in class and avoiding distraction, such as the use of cell phones
- Careful and complete note-taking in class
- Behaving in a manner that is respectful to the instructor and other students in the course.  

### Exams (25%)

The course will consist of 2 exams throughout the semester, a midterm and a cumulative final exam. The midterm will be worth 10% of the total grade and cover units 1 and 2. The final exam will be worth 15% of the total grade and covers units 1-4. 

### Laboratory (25%)

In the laboratory component of the course, students will work on an “authentic” research experience, separate from the lecture component of the course. Students will perform on a semester long project, where they will work on a single research question from beginning to end. Students will run an introductory experiment to learn how to use specific experimental methods and then will work on a research project that they design utilizing DNA barcoding. To learn more about DNA barcoding, visit the barcode of life website. 

The lab grade of the course will consist of the following components:

- Lab notebooks and assignments (15%)
- Pre-lab reading assignments (15%)
- Final lab poster (40%)
- Lab quizzes (20%)
- Participation and engagement (10%)


#### Lab notebooks and assignments

Each student is expected to keep an ongoing google document as a lab notebook throughout the semester. A lab notebook entry is required for each lab class. Lab notebook entries must be done in a timely manner as this is important to ensure accurate record keeping of experiments. **Lab notebook entries are due 24 hours after the end of lab**. Lab notebook entries are not accepted for lab classes which the student did not attend. See [lab notebook guidelines] (https://docs.google.com/document/d/13W_a1iGAdbQ8KvzBwWyXxJl30ugSJVRQ063Fk_rzMM4/edit?usp=sharing) for further information. 

In addition to lab notebooks, there will be multiple assignments throughout the semester to prepare students for the DNA barcoding project and to write a full lab report.

#### Pre-lab reading assignments

Students are expected to arrive to each lab class fully prepared for the day’s experiments. Background information and experimental protocols will be posted on blackboard for students to read. Students are expected to complete a pre-lab quiz 1 hour prior to the start of each lab class. 

#### Lab quizzes

Two quizzes will be given in the lab class to assess understanding of the lab project and the experiments done in class. Quizzes will be scheduled at least 1 week in advance. 

#### Final lab poster

Students will create a lab poster summarizing the class project. The poster should provide an accurate and complete overview of the experiment done in class including background information, methods, results figures, and a discussion of what the results mean. Students should be prepared to present the poster in front of instructors and/or other students. Students will begin working on the poster in the middle of the semester to receive feedback from the instructor on drafts. The final poster will be due at the end of the semester. 

#### Participation and engagement

Students are expected to fully participate in lab sessions. Students are expected to:

- Arrive on time and fully prepared for class
- Collaborate with group members
- Conduct experiments carefully and with attentiveness 
- Efficiently work through lab experiments and remain focused on lab tasks. 
- Promote a respectful environment for other students and instructors 

## Course policies

### Class participation and attendance

Students are expected to attend all lab and lecture class sessions and to actively participate. Class attendance is necessary to be successful in this course as there will be material that is only available by attending class. Furthermore, ***it is the student’s responsibility to obtain class notes when absent***. 

### Late Assignments

Late assignments will be 10% for each day late, up to 4 days late. After 4 days, the assignment will automatically receive a zero. Special dispensation may be given at discretion of the instructor for excused reasons, such as documented illness and emergencies. Instructor must be contacted prior to a due date. 

**In class assignments and weekly concept checks will not be accepted late and cannot be made up**. 

### Lab groups

Students will work in groups of 4 for the entirety of the semester. These groups will be determined the second week of lab. Lab groups are encouraged to work together and collaborate but all work, including lab notebooks, assignments, and reports must be done independently. 

### Lab Attendance 

This lab class is designed to give the student a more authentic research experience by working through a research question from beginning to end. The nature of this project means that each lab session builds on previous weeks, as the project takes many weeks to complete. Therefore, regular attendance is vital to the completion of the lab project. 
**More than two unexcused absences will result in automatic failure of the lab component of the course**. 

Lab classes will begin on time and students should be prepared to stay for the entirety of the lab class. **Lab classes where a student arrives more than 20 minutes late will be considered an _unexcused_ absence**, as it will be difficult to perform the lab experiment in less than the time allotted for the class session. 

Make-up labs _might_ be available for excused absences but are not guaranteed. If you must miss a lab for an excused reason, such as illness or family emergency, Dr. Glover must be notified ***prior*** to the start of lab through email.  

### Lab attire

Students are expected to follow lab safety protocols. This includes proper lab attire. Students are required to arrive to lab with closed toed shoes, long pants or skirts, and lab coats. **Students who arrive to lab without the proper attire will not be able to complete the lab and it will count as an unexcused absence**. Students should obtain their own lab coat. These can be found online or in a nurse or scrub store. 

### Technology

The use of cell phones is not permitted during class, unless specifically allowed by instructor. Please store devices during class periods. 

The use of tablets or computers is allowed during class, for *_note-taking purposes only_*. However, I strongly encourage you to use handwritten notes instead. Handwritten notes have been shown to be more effective than notes taken on the computer, as they allow you to better process the information from class, see [here](https://www.npr.org/2016/04/17/474525392/attention-students-put-your-laptops-away). Students who took handwritten notes have also been shown to score better on tests than those who used digital notes [see article] (https://www.gse.harvard.edu/news/uk/17/08/note-taking-low-tech-often-best). Furthermore, we will also be regularly drawing charts and figures in class. 

### Plagiarism/Academic dishonesty

Academic integrity is taken very seriously in this course. Please familiarize yourself with the university's policy (see below). 

University Policy Regarding Academic Honesty from the [Undergraduate catalog](https://www.bowiestate.edu/files/resources/catalog-undergraduate-2017-2019-2.pdf)

> Students are expected to conform to a strict standard of academic honesty. Cheating onexaminations, plagiarism, unauthorized collaboration with others on assignments, submittingwithout authorization duplicate assignments for credit in more than one course, and improper acknowledgment of sources of material are intolerable offenses that carry serious penalties.
> 
> **Policy on Plagiarism**

> 1. Plagiarism is the act of representing another’s ideas, words, or information as one’s own. Every student writing a paper should be aware of the following principles.
> 
>  - All directly quoted materials must be identified as such by quotation marks. The source(s) of this material must be acknowledged.
>  -  When borrowed ideas or information is not directly quoted by a student, the student should have so assimilated this material that it is indeed being expressed in his/her own words. However, just as in the case of direct quotations, the sources of suchborrowed ideas or information must be acknowledged.
> 
> 2. The sources of ideas or information lying well within the realm of common knowledge (i.e., material that would be known by anyone familiar with the subject under discussion) need not be acknowledged.
> 3. Students guilty of plagiarism are subject to severe penalties, ranging from failure for the assignment to failure in the course or, in extreme cases, dismissal from the University. The instructor, in consultation with the Departmental Chair and the School Dean,shall determine the appropriate sanction to be imposed. Students appealing the imposed sanction must present their appeal in writing to the Provost for a final resolution.
> 
>**Procedures for Handling Cases of Alleged Infractions of Academic Honesty**

> 1. Faculty members are required to deal directly with any academic infractions. Actions taken must reflect the seriousness of the infractions and could range from a verbal warning, an assigned grade of “F” for the course, academic suspension, to dismissal from the University. 
> 2. In cases where the instructor concludes that the infraction is severe, a recommendation may be made to the Dean for academic suspension or dismissal from the University.
> 3. The Dean may arrange a hearing with individuals (faculty members from another department and student from the Judicial Board) to evaluate the appeal. The Dean will render a final resolution.
