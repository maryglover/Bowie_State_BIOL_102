# Discussion assignments

Every module students will be expected to answer discussion questions in the ***#discussion-assignment*** channel in slack. Students will have 1 week to craft and post their initial response to the discussion question. They will then have an additional week to respond to other students in the discussion. 

**Due to the interactive nature of the discussions, late posts will not be graded and students will receive a 0 on the assignment**. All discussion assignments are due on Thursdays at 5:30 PM 

## Discussion expectations
To answer the discussion questions, students are expected to **critically apply** their knowledge from class and **reflect** on what they have learned. The discussion questions are not simple questions on module content but require students to demonstrate a solid understanding of the content and may require outside research. So students should plan ahead accordingly when completing discussion posts. 

Discussion posts are graded on student effort to contribute to the conversation and thorough reflection on the discussion questions. While there is no "correct" answer to the discussion questions, students are expected to **accurately** describe content from class or outside sources. 

Students are expected to engage with their peers in a productive and respectful manner. Disagreement is expected but students must be respectful at all times.
