## Channels
Slack uses channels to organize conversation. 

You can use the DMs or channels to ask questions in slack. However, it is strongly recommended that you use the channels for questions. It is likely that other classmates have the same questions as you do, and therefore will benefit from your question in the channel. Also, students can answer questions in the channels. This will mean that you may get a quicker response than if you DM'd your instructor instead. To direct a question in a channel to Dr. Glover, you can use the mention function. This will send a notificiation. To use mentions use the @, (@Dr. Glover)
